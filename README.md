# Jordan Choi - Portfolio V4.0

The official web portfolio of Jordan Choi - Year 1 Information Technology Student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.

This portfolio consists of my basic profile and information, past projects, education history and achievements, skills & proficiency, work experiences and lastly a contact component.

## Design Process & Rationale
This website is created to become my portfolio that contains information about myself that my future employers or companies/individuals seeking freelancers may be interested in.

Thus, this website is designed for them to learn more about me based on my biography, education history and past employments, identify my skills which they may require, and to contact me for potential projects or employment.

Putting myself in the perspective of the group mentioned earlier, this website should:

1. Have a decent UI & UX Design.
2. Have an introduction of myself.
3. Showcases my past projects.
4. Display Education & Employment history and highest education attained.
5. Allow employers/ freelancer hirers to identify the skills I possess.
6. Allow them to determine my suitability for the position based on the information or contents provided.
7. Have a contact platform for employment or engagement.

Since this site is not heavy in contents, I adopted SPA. With a single page style, it'll allow the mentioned users to view all of the information I'd like to convey in a glance.

My website is designed minimalistically and revolves around black and white colors with occasional use of gold and dark blue. The exact hex-code for the colors used in the site are:

#FFFFFF, #000000, #F5C647, #EDEDED, #FFD600, #08003E
Colors from icons and images are not included. Other colours not mentioned revolves around the shade of grey. 

I chose this colors because it work well together. I chose gold color to provide a warm and traditional vibe to the users. I used the color black to emphasis seriousness as my portfolio is supposed to look professional.

Last but not least, I used mostly white colors for the fonts and in certain areas for contrast to the dark backgrounds that the website have.
